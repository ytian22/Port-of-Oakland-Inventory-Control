## Background
The Port of Oakland operates on almost 500 hectares of space and is one of the largest ports on the west coast of the United States. Almost all the business at the port is done via containerization methods: 40 and 20 foot containers are put directly from ships onto trucks and rail. Despite the efficiency of this transportation method, some freight is unpackaged and repackaged onto other transportation methods at the port. <br>
<br>

This type of loose freight is difficult to deal with as the port operators need to decide when and how to ship it. The port operators are most efficient when trucks are operating at capacity, but with different size loose materials coming in to different destinations maintaining efficiency is difficult.  Table 2.1 shows a partial day manifest for Tuesday, December 8th. <br>
