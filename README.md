# Port of Oakland Inventory Control
The jupyter notebook shows the process of Monte-Carlo and Bootstrapping simulations and hypothesis tests on 4,989 observations to evaluate the statistical significance for a new inventory-controlling system. <br>

## Business
The Port of Oakland is one of the largest ports on the west coast of the United States. Its business is done via containerization methods: 40 and 20 foot containers are put directly from ships onto trucks and rail. <br>

## Problem
Some freight is unpackaged and repackaged onto other transportation methods at the port, which leads to a difficult problem as the operators need to decide when and how to ship it. The operators are most effcient when trucks are operating at capacity, but with different size loose materials coming in to different destinations maintaining effciency is diffcult.
